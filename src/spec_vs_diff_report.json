  "summary": "Diff implements a romantic pastel global theme via CSS variables, adds reusable motion components (Pressable/LiftCard/PressableRow), introduces fade+slide screen transitions via ScreenTransition in AppShell, adds lightweight ambient hearts/sparkles and avatar entrance/breathing animations, and includes reduced-motion handling. One apparent unrequested product feature (discovery search/filter) is described in the updated file summaries.",

    {
      "description": "Added an in-list search input / filtering logic on the Home/Discovery screen (same-city profiles filtered by name), which is a new product feature and explicitly listed as a non-goal (filters/new discovery logic).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals prohibit adding new product features like filters or new discovery logic; the diff summary text indicates such a feature exists.",
